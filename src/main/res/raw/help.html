<h2>Entry</h2>
<p>
  Letters that are shown green in the puzzle
  (<a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/billthefarmer/gurgle">Gurgle</a>)
  go in the first green row in the correct place. Yellow letters go in
  the next yellow rows in the correct place. Letters shown grey go in
  the last row in any order.
</p>
<h2>Solve</h2>
<p>
 Tap either the next button on the keyboard or the solve button in the
 toolbar. The next button only works if there is text where the cursor
 is, so it can be used to move to the next slot without triggering a
 search. The app will show a scrolling list of possible next guesses
 at the bottom.
</p>
<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>
  Select coloured theme from the <b>Theme</b> button in the toolbar.
</p>
<h2>External control</h2>
<p>
  Share text from another app, or send
  an <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent">Intent</a>
  with an <a
  href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#EXTRA_TEXT">EXTRA_TEXT</a>
  with the text containing the known letters and blanks or dots for
  the unknown letters. The app will start or restart and display the
  results. The parameters may be seen in a table in
  the <a href="https://github.com/billthefarmer/wordlesolver#external-control">README</a>.
